Grade studio

Critical-Urgent:
- Step 3
    - Can calculate the overall score with weighting
    - Adjust Area bug: B's area covers C's area (fixed but needs more testing)
    - When user click on a student, the point will be on the chart (Can explain to the student why eventually the point is at that position, relative to the whole class)
      (done)

Critical-Low:
- Step 1
    - Enable more types of csv file (auto detect the CSV data, only final scores? with sub-component?)
    - Send the analysis report to the student if the input is the email.
- Step 3
    - Sub-component comparison, e.g. good at mid-term, poor at final

Non-critical-Urgent:
- Step 1
    - Basic checking on csv file
- Step 3
    - save the state for next time

Non-critical-Low:
- Step 3
    - Hide student identity (for demo purpose, don't show the real identity)
    - Add more charts and statistics, e.g. Pie chart for the weighting
    - Sub-component analysis, like many students are poor in Assignment-2

Future Work:
- future learning analysis
- export data for education platforms (e.g. moodle)

I don't know where to put:
- Also the meta data of the Grading work
- preset weighting for users in setting page
- Fix and Fuzzy boundary for the grading, e.g.Â +- 5% for Grade-A
