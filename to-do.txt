From Patrick:

- adjust the Area easier
- show statistics for each grade (done)
- label the axis (done)
- manual adjust on the grade

- CSV file - more control, like include all the sub-components, the weighting for each component
- Also the meta data of the Grading work
- Add more charts and statistics, e.g. Pie chart for the weighting
- When user click on a student, the point will be on the chart
- Sub-component comparison, e.g. good at mid-term, poor at final
- Fix and Fuzzy boundary for the grading, e.g. +- 5% for Grade-A
- Can explain to the student why eventually the point is at that position, relative to the whole class, 
- Sub-component analysis, like many students are poor in Assignment-2
- Send the analysis report to the student if the input is the email. 
- To path the way for future learning analysis
- auto detect the CSV data, e.g. only final scores, or with sub-component, or even with the expected distribution (fix or fuzzy, e.g. 5% will get A) etc.
- add some basic checking on the CSV file
