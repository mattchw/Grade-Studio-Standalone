Grade studio

Critical-Urgent:

Critical-Low:
- Step 1
    - Enable more types of csv file (auto detect the CSV data, only final scores? with sub-component?)
    - Send the analysis report to the student if the input is the email.
- Step 2
    - preset weighting for users in setting page
- Step 3
    - Sub-component comparison, e.g. good at mid-term, poor at final
    - Export csv (customize: add course code) sort sid
    - Automatically giving grade to the chart area
    - Add histogram with best bin size/manually adjust bin size

Non-critical-Urgent:
- Step 1
    - Basic checking on csv file
- Step 3
    - Save the state for next time
    - Export file contains: graphs, grades, stats

Non-critical-Low:
- Step 1
    - Allow user to type filename
    - Fix and Fuzzy boundary for the grading, e.g. +- 5% for Grade-A
- Step 3
    - Disable exporting data
    - Hide student identity (for demo purpose, don't show the real identity)
    - Add more charts and statistics, e.g. Pie chart for the weighting (pie chart done)
    - Sub-component analysis, like many students are poor in Assignment-2
    - Customize grade (better with remarks)
    - Invitation for action (see student’s position on the chart)
    - Stat need: number of count 63/70 (population size), median
    - Two columns in the stat table
    - Flip the F D C B A —> A B C D F
    - Calculate the population of different grades rather than only percentage
    - Put a disclaimer and welcome feedback
    - Change the constraint of weighting not equal to 100%

Done:
Step 3:
- Can calculate the overall score with weighting (done)
- Adjust Area bug: B's area covers C's area (fixed but needs more testing)
- When user click on a student, the point will be on the chart (Can explain to the student why eventually the point is at that position, relative to the whole class)
  (done)

Future Work:
- future learning analysis
- export data for education platforms (e.g. moodle)

I don't know where to put:
- Also the meta data of the Grading work
- ***quatile will be shown if the graph can be done
- unit testing for scores

chart comparison:
- same students/different students, intra/inter

dashboard:
notification -> student submission
